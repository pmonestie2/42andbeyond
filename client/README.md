# 42 and Beyond: Unity Client

A desktop space client for the existing local Rust server, with a solid 3D ship,
procedural asteroids, stations, gates, a docking bay, a distant ringed planet,
and a sector chart.
Nearby players appear as solid replacement ships with their toon names and interpolated
movement. The server controls their visibility, including range and cloaking; ships
are removed when they leave visibility or log out. Mobs have distinct procedural models,
server names, interpolated movement, hostility markers, shields and hull readouts.
Positions and travel come from the server. Models are original procedural
placeholders; original game art and Net7Proxy are not required.

## Open and run

On the development Mac, Unity 6.3.13f1, Unity Hub, and Rosetta 2 are installed,
and the standalone application can be built from this project. Double-click **Play 42 and Beyond.command**
to connect to the Windows VM server. The launcher installs the current build in
`~/Applications/42 and Beyond.app` and writes its game log under
`~/Library/Logs/42 and Beyond/`, so the game does not request access to the
project's Documents folder. Quit the game before installing a newly built version.
The window can be resized; the HUD scales at small sizes.

Double-click **Play Local.command** in this directory to start the game and its own server together. It automatically
connects the demo character, keeps its state in ignored `.local-state/`, and stops
the owned server when the game closes. It never stops an unrelated server.
Launching it again brings the existing game forward instead of starting another
server. A project-local operating-system lock prevents simultaneous launches
from racing; it releases automatically even if a launcher exits unexpectedly.
Close the running game before using `--rebuild` or changing maps. Port conflicts
with another server are reported without a Python traceback, and failed startup
attempts preserve earlier server log output.

From a terminal, the equivalent is:

```sh
python3 client/Tools/play_local.py
```

Use `--rebuild` after changing client code, or `--sandbox-map` for the small test
sector. Normal play does not require opening the editor. The generated Mac app
is `Builds/42 and Beyond.app` and supports both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.

For a fresh machine or editor development:

1. Install Unity Hub and a Unity **6.3 LTS** editor for your platform. The project
   records `6000.3.13f1`; a newer 6.3 LTS patch can upgrade it. Choose the Apple
   Silicon editor on an ARM Mac. Unity also requires Rosetta 2 for supporting
   tools, even when the editor itself runs natively on Apple Silicon.
2. In Unity Hub, **Add project from disk** and choose this `client` directory.
3. Open `Assets/FortyTwoAndBeyond/Space.unity`. The runtime bootstrap creates the scene's
   camera, geometry, and connection panel when you press **Play**.
4. Start the Rust server in a separate terminal, from the repository root:

   ```sh
   cargo run --locked --manifest-path server/Cargo.toml -- --bind 127.0.0.1
   ```

5. Press Play, enter `127.0.0.1`, and connect. A fresh server's demo account is
   `local` / `local`. Use a space character that is not already logged in elsewhere.
   Passwords are not saved in project settings or PlayerPrefs.

To keep prototype play separate from existing local characters, add
`--state-dir /tmp/client-play` to the server command. Use a persistent directory
instead if you want that prototype character to survive temporary-file cleanup.
The default map is Asteroid Belt Alpha. For the four-object test map, also add
`--content server/data/sector.json` when running from the repository root.

To keep the server in the Windows VM, start it bound to its private LAN IPv4
address and enter that address in the connection panel. The existing TCP/UDP
ports must be reachable from the Mac. No server changes are required. This client
uses the local plaintext account bridge, so it accepts only explicit private or
loopback IPv4 addresses; it does not connect to the public game service.

The **Controls** panel in the upper right can rebind every keyboard action in
this table. Assigning a key already in use swaps the two actions. Changes are
saved locally; **Restore defaults** returns to the layout above.

The VM launcher uses the running server at `192.168.47.128`. The client reads that account's available toons and lets you
choose one before entering space. The current Windows VM has narrow inbound
firewall rules for TCP 3807 and UDP 3501, 3806, and 3808 from the Mac's VMware
host interface. If VMware assigns it a different address, edit the host in the
shortcut or type the new address in the login panel.
The normal login form starts with the Mac-hosted server's current VMware bridge
address, `192.168.47.1`. Its **Published sandbox pilots** section reads only the
server's advertised demo class codes. Choose a class to fill its public
`p`-prefixed class code as both account and password (for example, `pje`/`pje`),
then select **Enter Space**. All
nine classes appear when provisioned on that server. **Discover** refreshes the
list after changing the address. You can still type any other authorized account
manually. The VM launcher selects the Windows server explicitly.

Enter in flight opens the server chat command line. Type `/d_jump BBW` or
`/d_spawn 46 3` and press Enter to use the server's developer commands.

Warp to a gate first, then travel through it once stopped nearby. The server's
gate sequence takes approximately 15 seconds. Loss of window focus sends brake
and neutral steering. Disconnect and leaving Play mode cancel and join the
network worker before its session is released.

Select a station, warp nearby, then choose **Dock at station**. The server grants
clearance and moves the character to its interior. Characters already docked can
log in directly. The docking bay shows the parked ship, loadout and **Launch**.
The server announces the station layout. The client lists public NPC names and
follows the server-offered dialogue choices. A vendor branch opens its native
stock and buy/sell panels with server quotes and credit balance. Room movement
uses the station's advertised room buttons. The avatar enters each selected room
through native room and pose packets, and the contact list shows NPCs placed in
that room. The **Station Vault** panel stores full cargo stacks and retrieves
them while docked; the server publishes both container revisions after a move.

## Players, groups and mobs

The left **Contacts** list shows visible players and mobs. Type an online toon
name to invite somebody anywhere, or click a nearby player and use **Invite to
group** in the fixed target panel. That button sends the native group invitation
to the selected player ID. **Who is online** prints the available names in the message history.
The invited client can accept or decline; the group
panel reflects the server roster and leader role. Members can leave; leaders can
kick members or disband. Invitations expire after the server's 30-second window.
The roster lists the other members, with your own role in its heading. The leader
can choose Slot Back, Block or Pipe formation and release it later. Members can
form up within 5 km of the leader, or leave formation without leaving the group.
The leader can share the selected target with the group.

Press Enter for chat. The checkbox chooses group chat or sector chat. A short
message history remains visible. Slash commands still work, including `/invite
NAME`, `/accept`, `/decline`, `/leave`, `/disband`, `/kick NAME`, `/d_spawn
Achilles Drone 1` and `/d_jump`. Typing in chat suspends flight-key input;
Send and Escape return control to flight. A held thrust key resumes after
returning to flight or refocusing the window.

Select a mob in Contacts or click its ship in space for shield and hull readings.
Hostile contacts have red markers; other NPCs have gold markers. Press F or use
**Fire weapons** to target and fire; press F again or use **Stop weapons** to stop.
The server controls firing, hits, damage, movement and death. The client shows
weapon streaks and hit numbers. The ship loadout panel lists cargo, equipment,
weapon and device mounts; select cargo and a mount to equip, or select installed
gear to remove. The panel checks mount compatibility and cargo space before sending
native inventory transfers, and shows item condition, range and any server quote.
Ammo can be loaded through the same server move command. Defeated
mobs leave server-owned wrecks. Click a wreck to open its fixed loot panel;
within 2 km, open it and tractor listed items into cargo. The radar shows nearby
contacts and navigation targets.
The loadout shows each weapon's server firing state and loaded ammunition.
Select an installed weapon to toggle that hardpoint alone during space combat.
The Turbo Weapons button and B key activate a matching equipped device. The
server decides energy cost, firing-rate bonus, and duration; the HUD reflects
the server's activation and expiry messages.
Select a supported installed device in Ship Loadout to activate Scan Boost,
Increase Speed, Reactor Boost, or Turbo Weapons. The active effect label comes
from the server's acknowledgement and clears when the server ends the effect.

Explorer pilots can click a mineable asteroid or gas cloud, open its prospecting
window, and choose a server-listed ore slot. The server checks the ship, skill,
distance, reactor energy, and shared resource claim before it awards ore to cargo.
The panel shows the resource level, depletion, and stock from native packets.
The Skills button lists abilities advertised by the connected character's native
RPG packet. Selecting one sends the native activation command, and the panel
shows the server's charge and cooldown updates. The server applies target, range,
energy, charge, and cooldown rules. Refresh display labels from
the public Rust catalog with `python3 client/Tools/sync_ability_catalog.py`
after server skill-content changes. Click one of six slots in the Skills panel,
then an ability, to assign the flight bar. Slot keys default to 1–6 and can be
changed in Controls. Assignments are saved per character on this Mac.
When hull reaches zero, a rescue panel requests the native tow, distress, or
wait choices. Characters with Jumpstart can select their own ship and cast it
from the same panel; the server remains authoritative over recovery.
An incapacitated player offered Jumpstart by another pilot sees a separate
yes/no prompt in that panel. Accept and Decline send the native confirmation
actions; they do not answer a group invitation or choose a rescue NPC option.
While docked, Workbench opens manufacturing, analysis, dismantling, and refining.
Select a server-listed formula or place one cargo item in the analyzer, then use
the quoted action when the server marks it ready. Level buttons filter formulas;
Refine Stack uses the server's available run count. Closing the workbench cancels
an unfinished job without spending its materials or credits. The server sends
the completed item, cargo and credit updates.
The Missions button shows accepted missions, the current stage objective, and
earlier stage descriptions from the native journal. Kill counts and return
instructions update when the server publishes mission progress. NPC conversations
show server-announced mission offers, active objectives, acceptance, and completion;
the response buttons are the choices advertised by that NPC. The journal entry
remains the authority for the current stage and is removed on completion.
Models are placeholders rather than the original NPC assets. Station interiors
and the full original combat and equipment UI remain unfinished.

## Implementation boundaries

- `Assets/FortyTwoAndBeyond/Protocol`: engine-independent .NET Standard 2.1-compatible C#.
  Local TCP account bridge, character selection, UDP registration/handoff,
  ordering, bounded fragmented-frame reassembly, resend requests, keepalives,
  navigation decoding, player/MOB lifecycle and resource decoding, group AUX state, chat, motion commands,
  warp, and correlated gate activation.
- `Assets/FortyTwoAndBeyond/Client`: Unity main-thread input, shared solid meshes, camera and immediate
  mode prototype HUD. One Unity unit is 100 server meters; the view is centered
  on the player. Server +X maps to Unity +Z, and server +Z maps to Unity +Y.
- `ClientWorker`: one session owner; immutable display snapshots and a bounded
  input queue cross the thread boundary. Socket polling is cancellation-aware.
- Built-in rendering with lit surfaces, procedural sky and planet shaders, shared
  asteroid meshes, and interpolated server poses. No asset-store dependencies.
- Rendering targets 120 FPS in the foreground and 60 FPS while the window is visible behind another app.
  Unchanged static scenery is retained; navigation sorting is refreshed at 4 Hz.
  The HUD reports measured FPS and the slowest frame in each one-second interval.
  The client predicts local and visible remote ship movement between the server's
  roughly five-per-second position reports and corrects on each new pose.
  Normal play uses the standalone app, without the Editor's extra overhead.
- The combat and loadout panels cover selection, weapon toggling, health, cargo,
  hardpoints, equip/unequip, and wreck loot. Docking and launch work through the
  station handoff, room selection and avatar presence, NPC dialogue, vendor trading
  and vault storage.
  The account bridge supplies the toon names and selected server slot.

Physical scenery uses server positions and scale with approximate replacement
models. HUD markers stay readable independently of physical model sizes. Labels
are capped and separated to avoid overlap. The distant planet is decorative.
The code does not change the server, launch the original client, or start/stop
the Windows VM.

## Verification

Run pure protocol checks with a .NET 8 SDK; there are no NuGet dependencies:

```sh
dotnet run --project client/Tests/ProtocolChecks.csproj
```

Run the disposable local integration test from the repository root:

```sh
python3 client/Tests/run_local_smoke.py
```

On Windows, use `C:\PYTHON\python.exe` instead of `python3`. The harness builds
Rust and C#, starts an owned loopback server with two temporary accounts, checks
mutual player visibility, movement, logout removal, reentry, group invitation/decline/accept,
roster updates, group chat, kick/leave/disband, formation actions, inventory moves,
server MOB state, weapon effects, damage, wreck loot, station docking, a docked
reconnect, and launch, then stops it
in a cleanup block. It fails if the ports are occupied rather than stopping any
existing server. It must not be pointed at a live character session.

Verified on macOS: C# protocol checks; actual local bridge login, character
selection, UDP entry, map and position delivery, impulse, warp, gate activation
and destination entry, explicit logout/re-login, worker cancellation and join.
Unity builds and graphical checks are run separately from protocol checks.
Unity's editor can log an internal SearchDatabase indexing exception even when
compilation and Play mode succeed. Keyboard feel still needs human feedback.

Reproduce the build and graphical check with:

```sh
python3 client/Tools/verify_unity.py
```

It owns a disposable server, runs the editor, and saves `chase.png`, `chart.png`,
`asteroid.png`, `station.png`, `gate.png`, and logs under ignored `Builds/verification/`. Inspect the resulting images;
file existence alone does not establish that a layout looks correct.

Launcher regression checks (macOS, no game clients are driven):

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s client/Tests -p test_launcher.py -v
```

### Optional original-client HUD corner

The HUD can use the original `HUD01.dds` 8×8 corner tile when it is present at
`Assets/FortyTwoAndBeyond/Resources/LegacyHud01.dds`. It falls back to the
built-in corner if the file is absent. This optional binary is ignored by Git.
The locally verified source is `Data/client/mixfiles/mixfile_art_03.mix` in the
owned Windows Earth & Beyond installation: entry 681, offset 16,047,960,
length 240 bytes. The extracted DDS SHA-256 is
`f5396a236a48343948e7a6a62c45df735b2c6f35ac4a3594e30e6df2f5c3bf32`.
Keep the extracted DDS bytes unchanged; Unity creates its local `.meta` file.
